# Using Loops in R: Code-Through

## Introduction

Loops are a programming construct that allow us to run a chunk of code multiple times, helping improve efficiency and reduce redundancy in workflow. They are useful for running simulations, automated reporting tasks, and other repetitive actions like iterations and calculations.

In R programming, there are three main types of loops:
  - `for` loops: Repeats the code for a given number of iterations.
  - `while` loops: Repeats the code until a condition is met.
  - `repeat` loops: Similar to `while`, but requires an explicit termination.
  
All of these loop functions are part of base R and do not require additional packages to use.

## Common Examples of Looping

### 1. `for` Loops

A `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is predetermined, such as in a vector, list, or sequence.

**Syntax:**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (variable in sequence) {
  # execute code here
}
```

**Example:**
```{r}
# Print numbers from 1 to 5
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}
```

### 2. `while` Loops

A `while` loop will execute code for as long as a given condition is `TRUE`. These types of loops are useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, such as when performing simulations.

**Syntax:**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
while (condition){
  # execute code here
}
```

***Example:***
```{r}
i <- 1
while (i <= 5){
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}
```

### 3. `repeat` Loops

A `repeat` loop runs a chunk of code idefinitely until an explicit `break` statement is encountered. This is helpful when a scenario must be run at least once and the stopping condition is checked inside the loop.

**Syntax:**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
repeat{
  # execute code here
  if (condition) {
    break
  }
}
```

**Example:**
```{r}
# Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a repeat loop
x <- 1
repeat{
  print(x)
  x <- x +1
  if( x > 5){
    break
  }
}
```

*Note:* `while` and `repeat` loops are very similar in function, but remember that a `repeat` loop requires an explicit `break` command, otherwise it will run indefinitely and this will lead to bugs in your code if not used carefully.

### Jump Statements

Jump statements are used to terminate loops at a particular iteration or skip to another iteration in the loop. There are two main types of jump statements:

- `break` statement: used to terminate the loop at a particular iteration. Most oftened used in `repeat` loops but can also be used in `for` loops.
- `next` statement: used to skip an iteration of a loop and continue with the next iterations.

**Example:**
```{r}
# Skip an iteration in a loop
for ( i in 1:5 ){
  # Set condition
  if ( i == 3 ){
    next
  }
  # Finish for loop
  print( i )
}
```

## Conclusion

Loops are a powerful tool for automating tasks and improving your coding efficiency. Be sure to select the one that works best for your code and remember to include exit clauses when using `repeat` loops.

- Use `for` loops when iterating over a known sequence (e.g.,  numbers 1:5 or days Monday through Friday)
- Use `while` loops when you want the code to stop after a condition is met (e.g., x > 5 or a slots player runs out of cash, x = 0)
- Use `repeat` loops when a loop should run at least once and you want to set an explicit end condition.
